# Lab-3

The key generator is available in both python 2.7 and 3.5

Both versions require win32api to be installed on the computer in order to run the python file.

In addition, the Visual C++ tools must be installed, which can be found as part of the installation files of the Visual Studio packages.

A second version of the key generator is included for clarity on how each password is calculated.

The fifth password is found by running Pass5.exe, which is run automatically by the python key generator by reading the stdout buffer.
